## Wireframes
The wireframes were created using figma, they are a rough way to showcase the pages layout and design.  I designed 3 different screens for mobile, tablet and desktop for all the pages.  I went for a minimalist Home page, and with the colour palette I've choosen, to create a sense of class and style.
